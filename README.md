# Ktor HTTP Client with XML

Playing around with the Ktor HTTP client that has out of the box support for XML, and how fiddly it might be to get
working with a library not currently supported.

## Requirements
* Java, ideally 17 but the Java toolchain logic will detect it or download you one, assuming you have a JDK already.

## Docs
* Ktor Client v2.x - https://ktor.io/docs/serialization-client.html#register_xml
* Gradle Wrapper v7.x - https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html
* Java toolchain - https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/toolchains.html
* Kotlin Java toolchain - https://blog.jetbrains.com/kotlin/2021/11/gradle-jvm-toolchain-support-in-the-kotlin-plugin
